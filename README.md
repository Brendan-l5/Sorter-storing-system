Assigntmenttask2_main.py is the main file
There is a bool called arduino, it makes the hardware e-stop work + loads in all the swift environment models as they didn't work on koray's laptop. The arduino must be plugged in and the port must be set to the same usb port the arduino is in for the arduino function to work (including swift models)

Arduino.ino doesn't have to be loaded onto the board beforehand 

all of these files are in .venv folder and in another folder called At2

e.g. the shelf.stlk directory should be '.venv/At2/shelf.stl', same with all the other files
